    <h1>Hi, I’m Micayla Fong 👋</h1>
    <p>
      I am a current 4th year engineering student at the University of Southern California, set to graduate in May 2026!
      Throughout my time at USC I have had the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects enabled by the interdisciplinary structure of my major in computer science and business administration. During my studies there have been certain classes that I was particularly drawn to and that have truly inspired me. I found myself completely immersed and enjoying each challenge that these courses presented, but noticed that the subjects of my interests seemed to vary. From sports analytics to financial analysis, the disconnect relating to the diversity of my interests was initially inconsistent to me. Regardless of subject matter or the exact topics of the application, I realized that I have always enjoyed the classes that practice analytical reasoning and incorporate problem solving. I enjoy the challenge of understanding complex systems and uncovering patterns through information that might not be immediately obvious. This has become central to my academic identity and continues to shape my interests.
