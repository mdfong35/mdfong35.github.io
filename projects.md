  <h2>Data Analytics for Special Topics: Baseball Metrics</h2>
  <p>For this project I cleaned and transformed raw historical baseball datasets spanning 120 years, standardizing metrics and handling missing values to ensure consistency while avoiding selection bias in statistical analysis. My goal was to identify perfromance profiles that have been historically relevant. I wanted to uncover relationships between the various offensive and defensive metrics to ultimately inform reccomendations for training and competition strategy.</p>
  <h3>Analysis: </h3>
  <p>
    I performed linear regression analysis in R to determine statistically significant relationships between home game ratios and
8 other variables such as ERA, runs scored, and walks allowed. I then reduced dataset dimensionality using PCA and applied K-means clustering to uncover distinct team performance profiles. Finally, I applied Anova tests to validate statistical differences across clusters, supporting deeper exploration into strategic
implications of gameplay styles. To deliver my insights I developed a Tableau dashboard with graphs and visualizations to illustrate statistical relationships, enabling clear communication of performance patterns and findings to technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
