  <h2>Data Analytics for Special Topics: Baseball Metrics</h2>
  <p>For this project I cleaned and transformed raw historical baseball datasets spanning 120 years, standardizing metrics and handling missing
values to ensure consistency while avoiding selection bias in statistical analysis.
Analyses: 
    I performed linear regression analysis in R to determine statistically significant relationships between home game ratios and
8 other variables such as ERA, runs scored, and walks allowed. I then reduced dataset dimensionality using PCA and applied K-means clustering to uncover distinct team performance profiles. Finally, I applied Anova tests to validate statistical differences across clusters, supporting deeper exploration into strategic
implications of gameplay styles. To deliver my insights I developed a Tableau dashboard with graphs and visualizations to illustrate statistical relationships, enabling clear
communication of performance patterns and findings to technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
